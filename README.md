# Movie-app

An application that lists movies based on multiple filters as the newest, the most popular etc.

## Libraries used:

* [Retrofit2:](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) Used to fetch data from the API. I chose this library because it's:
  * Very simple to use.
  * Actively in development (it's regularly updated).
  * Plug and play components (ex. easy to change or convert to other data types if needed, you just have to choose another converter or       create custom ones, adaptive to all kinds of API URLs, etc).
  * Good community support.
  
* [Picasso:](http://square.github.io/picasso/) Used for downloading images and displaying them. I chose this library because it's:
  * Very simple to use (one line of code).
  * Handle many related stuff to images like cropping, caching, resizing etc.
  * Adaptive to a lot of scenarios.
